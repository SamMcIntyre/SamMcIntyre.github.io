        <h3>Our Solar System</h3>
        <p>
          We shall start with the basics of our Solar System. Below is a table
          which shows the dimensions of the Solar System and its constituents.
          Important terms used in the table are defined underneath it. Next to
          the definitions are some interesting things to note about our Solar
          System. Future updates to the site may broaden the horizons a bit, but
          for now, here is some info on the System we call home...

        <h3>Some Terms Defined...</h3>
        <dl id="defList">
          <dt>Astonomical Unit (AU)</dt>
            <dd>
              A unit of measure which is roughly the distance from the Earth to
              the Sun. It is exactly equivalent to 150 million kilometers (93
              million miles.)
            </dd>
          <dt>Aphelion</dt>
            <dd>
              The distance an orbiting body is when farthest from the central
              body around which it orbits.
            </dd>
          <dt>Perihelion</dt>
            <dd>
              The distance an orbiting body is when closest to the central body
              around which it orbits.
            </dd>
          <dt>Prograde Rotation</dt>
            <dd>
              Occurs when an orbiting body rotates in the same direction in
              which its central body rotates.
            </dd>
          <dt>Retrograde Rotation</dt>
            <dd>
              Occurs when an orbiting body rotates opposite the direction in
              which its central body rotates.

        <h3>Did You Notice...</h3>
        <p>
            The orbital distances from the sun scale up quite a bit as we move
          further from the sun. All 4 of the inner planets are within 2 AU
          from the sun, but then the outer planets are separated from eachother
          by much greater distances of up to nearly 10 AU! Furthermore, the
          distances between the aphelion and perihelion of the outer planets are
          surprisingly big. Consider the fact that a couple of the outer planets
          have differences of more than 1 AU, remember that that is greater than
          the distance from earth to the sun! Also notice how large the
          rotation times for Venus and Mercury are compared to the others, which
          are less than or roughly equal to 24 hours. Venus' is even longer than
          its orbital period, making one day on Venus longer than a year there!
          And finally, while all planets are orbitally prograde as they all
          orbit in the same direction that the sun rotates, significantly two
          of our planets actually rotate in retrograde. There are some theories
          as to why Venus and Uranus are different, and Venus is especially
          debated, but no one knows for sure.

        <h3>Something Is Missing...</h3>
        <p>
          Some may find that Pluto is unfortunately absent from the list of
          planets in our Solar System. It has been famously demoted from planet
          to dwarf planet in a controvertial, yet totally rational, move by
          the general astronomers' community. Unfortunately it fails to meet the
          planetary condition of being the dominant body in its orbital path as
          it clashes with other nearby dwarf planets like Eris for that title.
          Therefore it fails to be a full-time planet and is rather just a dwarf
          planet. As I understand this may be difficult to come to terms with
          for some hardcore pluto fans, I have included one of the few images
          of Pluto, taken by the New Horizons probe just recently.
