      Below this is a little meme I found on the internet about github. I don't
      know why it is funny but there it is. I don't understand it because I
      haven't used github enough to know much about the way it works and I
      haven't used it to make big changes and have to commit them and stuff. I
      am trying to fill the space with a lot of text so I just keep writing.
      The seal has a silly face and we anthropomorphise his expression and
      think he looks like he just forgot to pull before he started working.
      <img src="githubMeme.jpg" alt="a seal macro with a joke about github"
      title="Github Meme" hight="400" width="540" align="right" />
      And here is some more text after the picture which is showing how the
      browser is dealing with the picture. As we can see, the browser aligns it
      to the right and then continues the paragraph with just one space where
      the img tag is. Also the words wrap around the picture and do not go
      behind it. Instead, a new line is started. Below I will put the picture
      again in a figure tag in case you can't see it above/to the right.
