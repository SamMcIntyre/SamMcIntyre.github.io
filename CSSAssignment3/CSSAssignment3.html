    <p>
        These are the places I want to go. They include the Irish coast, the
      Grand Canyon, Lake Flathead, Edinburgh, New York, and Venice. I want to
      go to the coast of Ireland because I want to see the sheer rocky cliffs
      clash with the massive waves. The water there is notoriously powerful
      and I want to see that raw natural pawer with my own eyes. I also want to
      go to the Grand Canyon because it is simply absolutely massiveâ€”the
      largest gorge in the world. Lake Flathead has beautifully clear water
      that looks really cool. Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, has a giant
      castle in its center that I want to see and tour. New York is the classic
      American city and I want to go because I have never been. And finally, I
      want to go to Venice rather soon because it will likely sink into the
      ocean in the near future. I have a mix of natural and human-made wonders
      within this list and there is certainly more stuff I would like to see
      but I could only put six here for now as they are my top picks must see.
      Traveling is awesome so I hope these aren't the only stuff I see but I
      must at least see this stuff.
