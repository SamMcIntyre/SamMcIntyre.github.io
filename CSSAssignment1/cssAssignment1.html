        The Cascade Volcanoes (also known as the Cascade Volcanic Arc or the
        Cascade Arc) are a number of volcanoes in a volcanic arc in western
        North America, extending from southwestern British Columbia through
        Washington and Oregon to Northern California, a distance of well over
        700miles (1,100 km). The arc has formed due to subduction along the
        Cascadia subduction zone. Although taking its name from the Cascade
        Range, this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one,
        and the Cascade Volcanoes extend north into the Coast Mountains, past
        the Fraser River which is the northward limit of the Cascade Range
        proper.
